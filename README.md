# springRefresh



Created during the holidays of 2025 and continued as a mini pet project into 2026, this serves as a refresher of Web and devOps technologies i have or not have used in a while.



Steps:

1. Create an "old school" web app with an embedded Tomcat - available at release/v1-basic-servlet-webapp
   https://github.com/petruboulescu/springRefresh/tree/release/v1-basic-servlet-webapp
2. Move to Spring (not Spring Boot)
3. Add database functionality
4. Move to Spring Boot
5. Move to Spring Data
6. Infrastructure as code introduction
7. Add tests
8. Add integration tests
9. Add devOps features (Kubernetes clusters, local deployments, etc)
